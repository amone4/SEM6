week 1-2
	forensic science: application of physical sciences to law in the search for truth in civil, criminal, and social behavioural matters to the end that injustice shall not be done to any member of the society

	main points:
		application of scientific method for investigation
		activities should relate to courts of law

	cyber forensics activities commonly include:
		secure collection of computer data
		identification of suspect data
		examination of suspect data to determine details such as origin and content
		presentation of computer-based information to courts of law
		application of a country's laws to computer practice

	digital forensics: it is the use of scientifically derived and proven methods towards the preservation, collection, validation, identification, analysis, interpretation, documentation and presentation of digital evidence derived from digital sources

	computer forensics: it is the lawful and ethical seizure, acquisition, analysis, reporting and safeguarding of data and meta-data derived from digital devices

	network forensics: the study of network traffic to search for truth in civil, criminal and administrative matters to protect users and resources from exploitation, invasion of privacy and any other crime fostered by the continual expansion of network connectivity

	basic components of computer forensics investigation methodology:
		acquiring evidence
		authenticating evidence
		analysing data
	(integrity of evidence should be maintained in all components)

	basic order for forensics: CPU, cache and register content, routing table, ARP cache, process table, kernel statistics, temporary file system, data on hard disk, remotely logged data and data contained on archival media

	most accepted definition of cyber-crime: a crime in which a computer was directly and significantly instrumental

	two types of cyber crimes:
		techno-crime: premeditated act against a system or systems, with an intent to copy, steal, prevent access, corrupt, or damage parts of or the complete computer system
		techno-vandalism: defacement of websites, and/or other activities such as copying files and publicising their contents

	differences between terrestrial and cyber crimes:
		how to commit them is easier to learn
		they require few resources relative to the potential damage caused
		they can be committed in a jurisdiction without being physically present in it
		they are often not clearly illegal

	cyber-terrorism: a person, group, or organisation, with terrorist intent, utilising electronic systems, committing a terrorist attack

	phishing: refers to an attack using mail programs to deceive or coax internet users into disclosing confidential information that can be then exploited for illegal purposes

	pharming: redirecting a websites traffic to another website

	spoofing: altering data and masquerading as someone else

	wire transfer attack:

	cyber-security: protecting information, equipment, devices, computer, computer resource, communication device and information stored therein from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction

	types of cyber-criminals:
		type 1 - hungry for recognition
		type 2 - not interested in recognition
		type 3 - insiders

	classification of cyber-crimes:
		crimes against individuals: email spoofing, phishing, spear phishing, vishing, smishing, spamming, cyber-defamation, cyber-stalking, computer sabotage, password sniffing

		crimes against property: credit card fraud, intellectual property crimes, internet time theft

		crimes against organisation: unauthorised access, password sniffing, denial of service, virus attack, email bombing, salami attack, logic attack, data diddling, industrial espionage, computer network intrusions, software piracy

		crimes against society: forgery, cyber-terrorism, web jacking

	usenet groups may carry very offensive, harmful, inaccurate or otherwise inappropriate material, or in some cases, postings that have been mislabelled or are deceptive in another way

	search engine spamming: pages created deliberately to trick the search engine into offering inappropriate, redundant, or poor-quality search results

	search engine spamming can be avoided by avoiding:
		repeating keywords
		use of keywords that don't relate to the site
		use of fast meta refresh
		redirection
		IP cloaking
		use of coloured text on same colour background
		duplication of pages with different URLs

	cyber-defamation: defamation with the help of computer and/or internet
	the law on defamation attempts to create a workable balance between two equally important human rights
		the right to an unimpaired reputation
		the right to freedom of expression

	internet time theft: occurs when an unauthorized person uses the internet hours paid for by another person - related to identity theft

	data diddling: involves altering raw data just before it is processed by a computer and then changing it back after the processing is completed

	there are two distinct business models for cyber-crime applied to industrial spying: selling trojan-ware; selling stolen intellectual property

	purpose of hacking: greed, power, publicity, revenge, adventure, desire to access forbidden information, destructive mindset

	--- read slides from 40 - 46 ---

	cyber-crimes in India are punishable under 2 categories: ITA 2000 and IPC

	extended enterprise: represents the concept that a company is made up not just of its employees, its board members and executives, but also its business partners, its suppliers and even its customers

	netizen is someone who spends considerable time online and also has a considerable presence online (through websites about the person, through his/her active blog contribution and/or also his/her participation in the online chat rooms)
	the 5P netizen mantra for online security is: precaution, prevention, protection, preservation and perseverance

week 4
	exploits
		inadequate border protection (border as in the sense of network periphery)
		remote access servers (RASs) with weak access controls
		application servers with well-known exploits
		misconfigured systems and systems with default configurations

	cyber-crime might be a single event or a series of events

	phases of planning a cyber-crime
		information gathering (usually passive) - footprinting (accumulating data about target's environment) - tools that can be used for passive attack (google earth, people search)
		scanning information gathered to identify vulnerabilities
		launching the attack

	active attack: involves probing the network to discover individual hosts to confirm the information gathered in the passive attack phase - involves the risk of detection - active reconnaissance can provide confirmation to an attacker about security measures in place - tool: arphound, arping, bing, bugtraq, dig, dnstracer

	objectives of scanning: port scanning, network scanning, vulnerability scanning

	steps in attack: crack the password; exploit the privileges; execute the malicious commands/applications; hide the files (if required); cover the tracks

	social engineering can be
		human based: impersonating an employee; posing as an important user; using a third person; calling technical support; shoulder surfing (seeing the password); dumpster diving (sorting through the computer junk files)
		computer based: fake emails, email attachments, pop-up windows

week 5-6
	cyber-stalking: use of information and communications technology, particularly the internet, by an individual or group of individuals to harass another individual, group of individuals, or organization

	types of stalkers: online and offline

	ITA: Indian information technology act

	cyber-cafes - network service providers - liable for any cyber-crime committed inside their network

	tips for security in cyber-cafe:
		always logout
		stay with the computer
		clear history and temporary files
		be alert
		avoid online financial transactions
		change passwords
		virtual keyboard
		security warnings

	steps for secure system: anti-virus up to data; firewall; OS with security patches; disconnect internet when not in use; freeware only from trusted websites; checking outgoing mails

	attack vector and payloads: if an attack vector is thought of as a guided missile, its payload can be compared to the warhead in the tip of the missile

	cloud services - public; private; virtual private (e.g. a folder on google drive, shared with only a few people)

	risks with cloud computing: elevated user access; regulatory compliance; location of the data; segregation of data; recovery of data; information security violation reports; long-term viability

	steganography: method that attempts to hide the existence of a message or communication

	steganalysis: art and science of detecting messages that are hidden in images, audio/video files using steganography

	hot spares: machines that can be placed into service quickly if a similar machine is disabled

	types of buffer overflow attacks: stack-based; NOPs; heap

	components of wireless network: access points; wireless device

	types of credit card frauds:
		traditional techniques: criminal uses stolen and fake documents to build PII (personally identifiable information)
		application fraud: ID theft; financial fraud (giving fake information)
		modern techniques: skimming (copying information on credit card strip or smart chip); site cloning

week 7
	cyber-theft: using a computer and network to steal information, money, or other valuables - closely related to cyber-fraud
	ways:
		embezzlement: entrusted person exploiting trust for monetary gain
		industrial espionage
		plagiarism
		piracy
		identity theft
		DNS cache poisoning

	factors prioritizing cyber-crime enforcement:
		extent of harm
		frequency of occurrence
		availability of personnel
		training of personnel
		jurisdiction
		difficulty of investigation
		political factors

	criminal profiling: the art and science of developing a description of a criminal’s characteristics (physical, intellectual, and emotional) based on information collected at the scene(s) of the crime(s)
	methods:
		inductive: specific to the general - statistics applied to already known criminals and crimes
		deductive: general to the specific - information about the crime scene is used

	deductive method involves several distinct steps:
		a problem is stated
		information is collected
		a working hypothesis is formulated
		the hypothesis is tested
		results of the test are examined
		one or more conclusions are reached

	use of criminal profile
		to narrow the field of suspects
		to link related crimes
		to give investigators valuable leads to follow

	use of victimology
		it allows law enforcement officers to predict what people or personality types are likely to become victims of certain crimes and warn them
		this in turn gives the potential victims the opportunity to take steps to protect themselves
		it allows law enforcement officers to better profile the criminal, because patterns in victim choice are an important part of the criminal profile

	categorizing victims of cyber-crime
		people who are new to the net
		people who are naturally naive (sometimes including the young and the elderly)
		people who are disabled or disadvantaged
		the desperate, who are greedy, are lonely, or have other emotional needs
		pseudo-victims who report having been victimized but actually were not
		people who are simply unlucky enough to be in the wrong (virtual) place at the wrong time

	understanding the criminal’s motive is useful at two points in the investigation:
		when we are creating a profile to help us identify the correct suspect(s)
		when we present the case against our suspect

	common motives for committing cyber-crimes include:
		for fun
		monetary profit
		anger, revenge, and other emotional needs
		political motives
		sexual impulses
		serious psychiatric illness

	abstract qualities of a cyber investigator:
		excellent observation skills
		good memory
		organization skills
		documentation skills
		objectivity
		knowledge
		ability to think like a criminal
		intellectually controlled constructive imagination (creative)
		curiosity
		stamina
		patience
		love of learning

	technical knowledge required for a cyber investigator
		a basic understanding of computer science
		an understanding of computer networking protocols
		knowledge of computer jargon
		an understanding of hacker culture
		knowledge of computer and networking security issues

	types of investigator
		investigators who specialize in computer/network crime
		computer specialists who conduct investigations
		those who are equally skilled, trained, or interested in investigation and IT
		those who have no real skills or interest in either investigation or IT

week 8
	three major roles when conducting an investigation:
		first responder: identifying the crime scene; protecting the crime scene; preserving temporary and fragile evidence
		investigator: establishing chain of command; conducting crime scene search; maintaining integrity of evidence
		crime scene technician: preserving volatile data and duplicating disks; shutting down systems for transport; tagging and logging the evidence; packaging evidence; processing the evidence

	investigation methodology is the practices, procedures, and techniques used to collect, store, analyse, and present information and evidence to court of law

	three stages of computer forensic investigation
		acquisition: act of gathering information
		authentication: acquired evidence is same as originally seized data
		analysis: examining and evaluating information

	a policy is used to address concerns and identify risks to a company, whereas procedures are used to provide information on how to perform specific tasks and/or deal with a problem
	through the procedure, people are shown how to abide by policies by specific instructions

	acceptable use policies: also specify methods of how information can be distributed to the public
	incident response policies: implemented to provide an understanding of how certain incidents are to be dealt with

	six steps of investigation process:
		preparation
		detection
		containment
		eradication
		recovery
		follow-up
