commands
	imread(<name.extension>) => reads an image
	rgb2gray(<variable holding image>) => converts coloured image to grey
	size(<variable holding image>[, <1|2>]) => size of image in row column form. 1 returns only rows, and 2 returns only columns
	imshow(<variable holding image>) => shows image. typecast the parameter to unint8, if this does not work
		title(<title>) => give the image a title. use after imshow()
		figure => to show multiple images on separate windows. use this after every call to imshow()
		subplot(<rows>,<colums>,<cell number>) => shows multiple images in a single window. use this before every call to imshow()
	imhist(<variable holding image>) => drawing a histogram of an image. X axis shows the intensity, and Y axis shows the occurrence of that intensity
